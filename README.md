# Aloha-Android-IOS-App
This is a prototype of the Aloha app for Android users and IOS users. This prospectus will outline the basic business model for the mental health app that will provide personalized recommendations for managing stress/anxiety/depression, telehealth appointments direct-to-app with licensed therapists/psychiatrists, and CBT/meditation reminders daily. There are three main revenue streams which will be explored and these are monthly subscription models for users, partnerships with healthcare providers or insurance providers, and corporations looking to support their employees. 

Mental health is a growing concern in the United States and it will continue to grow unless there is a concerted effort to thwart this crisis that has been growing in recent years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified the need for accessible mental health support. Aloha aims to bridge the gap between individuals in need of mental health support and licensed mental health professionals through a convenient and user-friendly platform.
